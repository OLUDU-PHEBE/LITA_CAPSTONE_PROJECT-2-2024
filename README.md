# PROJECT TITLE: Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service

## PROJECT OVERVIEW:

The aim of performing Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service is to gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and purchasing patterns. By analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify 
segments and trends. The goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types, and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. The final deliverable is a Power BI 
dashboard that presents the analysis to help the organisation understand the different characteristics and behaviors of customers in order to better target and personalize marketing efforts, increase customer satisfaction and retention, and ultimately improve the overall business performance. By segmenting customers based on factors such as demographics, purchasing behavior, preferences, and engagement levels, the subscription service can tailor their offerings and communication strategies to better meet the needs and interests of each segment. This can lead to increased customer loyalty, higher conversion rates, and ultimately, higher revenue for the business.


## KEY INSIGHTS FOCUSED ON: 

**1. Identifying high-value customers:** Analyze customer data to identify which customers are the most valuable to the business in terms of lifetime value, frequency of purchase, average order value, and overall engagement. This can help the subscription service focus their marketing efforts on retaining and upselling to these high-value customers.

**2. Understanding customer preferences and behaviors:** Use data analysis to uncover patterns in customer behavior, such as preferred subscription plans, content consumption habits, and usage patterns. This information can help the subscription service tailor their offerings to better meet customer needs and interests.

**3. Churn prediction:** Predicting customer churn is crucial for a subscription service, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By analyzing customer data and identifying early warning signs of churn, the subscription service can proactively take steps to prevent customers from canceling their subscriptions.

**4. Personalization opportunities:** Use customer segmentation to personalize marketing campaigns, product recommendations, and communication strategies for different customer segments. This can help improve customer engagement, satisfaction, and overall retention rates.

**5. Market segmentation:** Analyze customer segments based on demographics, psychographics, geographic location, and other relevant factors to identify new market opportunities and tailor marketing strategies to specific target audiences.

By focusing on these key insights, this report can help subscription services improve customer retention, increase customer lifetime value, and drive overall business growth.

## DATA SOURCE 
 The main data sources for performing customer segmentation for a subscription service typically include:

1. Customer transaction data: This includes information on customer purchases, subscription plans, payment history, frequency of purchases, and average order value. Analyzing transaction data can help identify high-value customers, patterns in purchasing behavior, and opportunities for upselling or cross-selling.

2. Customer demographic data: Demographic information such as age, gender, income level, occupation, geographic location, and household size can help segment customers into different groups based on their characteristics and preferences.

3. Customer engagement data: This includes data on customer interactions with the subscription service, such as website visits, content consumption, app usage, email open rates, and participation in promotions or events. Analyzing customer engagement data can help identify active versus inactive customers, as well as preferences and behaviors that drive engagement.

4. Customer feedback and survey data: Feedback from customer surveys, reviews, and customer service interactions can provide valuable insights into customer satisfaction, preferences, and pain points. Analyzing feedback data can help improve customer service, product offerings, and overall customer experience.

5. External data sources: In addition to internal data sources, external data sources such as social media data, market research reports, and third-party data providers can provide additional insights into customer behavior, market trends, and competitive landscape.

By combining and analyzing data from these sources,the company can gain a comprehensive understanding of customer segments, preferences, and behaviors, and use this information to drive targeted marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and drive business growth for the subscription service.

## DATA MANIPULATION

### MICROSOFT EXCEL (using PIVOT TABLE) 

#### Report on total revenue by year (2022 and 2023)
![Screenshot (55)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/233982f1-80fb-4a7f-8790-3a2ece13944f)

key insights:
- in the year 2022 the total revenue was 89,902,969  while year 2023 has the total revenue of 59,916,717. the key insight is that there is a fall or short of turnover. this can be as a result of

1. Total customers that subcribed in 2022 were 12 customers in total with total revenue of  89,902,969 
2. Total customers that got their subscription canceled in the year 2022 was 5 with the total revenue of  37,517,170 
3. Total customers that subcribed in 2023	were 8 customers in total with total revenue of  59,916,717 
4. Total customers that got their subscription canceled in the year 2023 was 4 with the total revenue of 29,956,293 

- This shows that there was **-33.35%** 2023 **precentage difference** in the sales turnover from 2022 which can be as a result of:
1. Not paying attention to the customer’s needs
- Are they satisfied with your current products or services?
- Are they asking for more features? More benefits?
- Do they still love your products? 
2. Poor working conditions: Employees must be happy and comfortable in their working areas, otherwise it will hinder productivity which, in turn, impacts your sales performance.
3. The product or service has no Unique Value Proposition:  What makes the company's subcription so special that the customers have to choice the company's subscription service to our other competitors?
4. Scaling when you’re not yet ready: Let’s say our business did so great for previous year. It’s gone better than expected and revenues have doubled over projections. So,the company hire more people and you get more merchandise. Then after six months people are no longer subscribing to our product. It wasn’t ready to scale to that level just yet. You only scale when you’re ready. 		
			
 #### Report on total count of customers that canceled their subscrption for each year
![Screenshot (57)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ae5f42b-6814-49e7-a767-e2788eb0864e)

The total count of customers that canceled their subcription for year 2022 was 5 (five)  with the total revenue of 37,517,170 while in the year 2023 was 4 (four) with the total revenue of  29,956,293.  

**key insights:**
1. The customers that got their subscription canceled for both years where different in the sense that there was no repeated cancellation of subscription.
2. This might also have affected the revenue for 2023 as it has a low customer subscription rate and its also less of 1 customers that got their subcription cancelled compared to 2022 record.
 which may be as a result of Customer Dissatisfaction , Better Alternatives in the subscription business market, many retailers offer the same thing you offer, Changing Circumstances, Billing and Payment Problems, Limited Features and Functionalities and more 

**Suggestion:** I suggest that the management get through to these customers to get their detailed feedback has to why they got their subcription canceled before the due date. 

#### Report on the most popular subscription types. 
![Screenshot (58)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/555e764c-f521-408f-972d-037616c43688)

The most popular subscription type using pivot table is Basic with the total revenue of  44,913,187 
and  29,843,597 for both years respectively. The likely reason might be as its an economized means which low income earners can easily afford and at the same time relax
